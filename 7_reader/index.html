        <div class="col col1of2">
          <div class="dp">
            <p>In 1979,  <span class="rollover r-richard">Richard Dawkins</span> published <span class="rollover r-selfish">The Selfish Gene</span>, in which he discredits the idea that living beings are genetically compelled to behave in ways that are <span class="rollover r-species">“good for the species.”</span> Dawkins accomplishes this by making one point clear: the basic units of genetics are not species, families, or even individuals but rather single genes—unique strands of <span class="rollover r-DNA">DNA</span>.</p>

            <p>At the end of the book, Dawkins discusses two areas where evolutionary theory might be heading next. It is here that he coins the term <span class="rollover r-meme">meme</span>. He acknowledges that much of human behaviour comes not from genes but from culture. He proposes that any non genetic behaviour be labeled as a meme and then poses a question: can the application of genetic logic to memes be productive? To make the differences between genes and memes clear, I offer a short example of each.</p>

            <p>Genes determine an organism’s physical characteristics. A certain <span class="rollover r-gene">gene</span> causes an organism to have <span class="rollover r-shortleg">short legs</span>, or long, for instance. Imagine <span class="rollover r-zebras">two zebras</span>. The first has the short-leg gene, and the second the long. A <span class="rollover r-lion">Lion</span> attacks them. The short-legged zebra runs more <span class="rollover r-slowly">slowly</span> and is eaten. The long-legged <span class="rollover r-zebra">zebra</span> runs more quickly (because of its legs) and lives. At this point, there are more long-leg genes in the imaginary ecosystem than short-leg genes.If the long-legged <span class="rollover r-zebra">zebra</span> breeds and has offspring, those offspring with long legs will continue to survive at a higher rate, and more offspring of those offspring will contain the long-leg <span class="rollover r-gene">gene</span>. The genes themselves are not thinking beings—the long-leg gene does not know it causes long-leggedness, nor does it care, but given that it bestows a property that interacts with the environment to allow more of itself to be produced, it is successful.</p>

            <p>Memes determine the behaviour of an organism. Tey are either taught to an organism (you go to school and learn math) or learned through experience (you stick a finger in an outlet, get shocked, understand that outlets should be avoided). Imagine <span class="rollover r-soccer">two soccer players</span>. There are genetic factors which might make them better or worse at playing (long or short legs, for instance); however, their ability is also dependent on their understanding of the game. For this example, let us imagine that the two players are physically identical. However, one of them goes to practice, and the other does not. At practice, the coach teaches the attendant player about passing: you pass the ball to other players and increase the chance that your team will score. During a game, the attendant player is likely to pass and to experience success because of it. Te truant player, having not learned the passing <span class="rollover r-meme">meme</span>, will not pass, and that player’s team will suffer because of it.</p>

            <p>While <span class="rollover r-genes">genes</span> rely on the physical process of reproduction to replicate, memes rely on the mental processes of observation and learning. In our example, the truant player comes to the game without the passing <span class="rollover r-meme">meme</span> and suffers. Tat player is, however, able to observe the attendant player passing, and succeeding, and can decide to imitate the attendant player by passing as well. Te passing <span class="rollover r-meme">meme</span> successfully replicates itself in a new organism without the all-or-nothing cycle of life and death. Tis highlights one of the critical differences between genes and memes: speed of transmission. Compared to genetic changes (which span generations upon generations), memetic changes happen in the blink of an eye. Offline memes, cultural cornerstones like <span class="rollover r-language">language</span> or religion, are hyper fast when compared to their genetic counterparts. Internet memes are even faster.
            </p>

            <p>The other notable difference between genes and memes is their relative fidelity of form. In our zebra example, a <span class="rollover r-zebra">zebra</span> is granted physical characteristics based on a discrete combination of DNA. All the genes that Dawkins discusses are at their most basic made up of sequences of only four chemicals. Te memes that I examine in this essay, however, are not made up of chemicals but of ideas and concepts. Our truant player may observe and learn the passing <span class="rollover r-meme">meme</span>, but that process does not transfer an identical chemical <span class="rollover r-code">"code"</span> for passing.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col col1of2">
          <div class="dp">
            <p>The meme is subject to interpretation and therefore to variation. In Dawkins’s original framing, memes described any cultural idea or behaviour. <span class="rollover r-fashion">fashion</span>, <span class="rollover r-language">language</span>, <span class="rollover r-religion">religion</span>, <span class="rollover r-sport">sport</span> all of these are memes. Today, though, the term <span class="rollover r-meme">"meme"</span>”—or specifically “Internet meme”—has a new, colloquial meaning.</p>

            <p>While memes themselves have been the subject of entire books, modern Internet memes lack even an accurate definition. There are numerous online sources (Wikipedia, Urban Dictionary, <span class="rollover r-knowyourmeme">Know Your Meme</span>, Encyclopaedia Dramatica) that describe Internet memes as the public perceives them, but none does so in an academically rigorous way. Given this, I have found the following new definition to be useful in the consideration of Internet memes specifically:</p>

            <p>An <span class="rollover r-memes">Internet meme</span> is a piece of culture, typically a joke, which gains influence through online transmission.</p>

            <p>While not all Internet memes are jokes, comparing them to ofine jokes makes it clear what makes Internet memes unique: the speed of their transmission and the fidelity of their form. A spoken joke, for instance, can only be transmitted as quickly as those individuals who know it can move from place to place, and its form must be preserved by memory. A printed joke, in contrast, can be transmitted by moving paper and can be preserved by a physical arrangement of ink. Te speed of transmission is no longer limited by the movement of individuals, and the form of the joke is preserved by a medium, not memory.</p>

            <p>Now, consider a joke that exists on the <span class="rollover r-internet">Internet</span>. The speed of transmission is increased yet again, in an incredible way. Space is overcome: computers connect to one another through far-reaching networks. Time is overcome:</p>

            <p>the digitally represented information is available as long as the server hosting it remains online. A joke stored on a website can be viewed by as many people as want to view it, as many times as they want to, as quickly as they can request it.</p>

            <p>An online joke’s fidelity of form, however, is subject to a unique contradiction.Being digital, the joke is perfectly replicable. Copy and paste functions (or their equivalents) are ubiquitous, expected parts of software platforms. However, a piece of digital media in the modern landscape of robust and varied manipulation software renders it also perfectly malleable. Individual sections of a piece of digital media can be lifted, manipulated, and reapplied with little effort. </p>

            <p>Once I say that a piece of media, or a <span class="rollover r-meme">meme</span>, is replicable and malleable, I must specify what exactly is being copied or changed. A <span class="rollover r-meme">meme</span> can be separated into components. I propose three: the manifestation, the behaviour, and the ideal.</p>

            <p>The manifestation of a <span class="rollover r-meme">meme</span> is its observable, external phenomena. It is the set of objects created by the meme, the records of its existence. It indicates any arrangement of physical particles in time and space that are the direct result of the reality of the meme.</p>

            <p>The behaviour of a meme is the action taken by an individual in service of the meme. The behaviour of the meme creates the manifestation. For instance, if the behaviour is <span class="rollover r-photo">photographing a cat</span> and manipulating that photograph with software, the manifestation this creates is the ordered progression of pixels subsequently uploaded to the Internet.</p>

            <p>The ideal of a <span class="rollover r-meme">meme</span> is the concept or idea conveyed.7 The ideal dictates the behaviour, which in turn creates the manifestation. If the manifestation is a funny image of a <span class="rollover r-cat">cat</span> and the behaviour is using software to make it, then the ideal is something like <span class="rollover r-cats">"cats are funny".</span></p>

            <p>When tracking the spread of a particular <span class="rollover r-meme">meme</span>, it is useful to identify which of these three aspects is being replicated and which adapted. <span class="rollover r-dawkins">Dawkins</span> prefigures this in his original chapter by theorising that the principal tool for meme identification would be the perception of replication. This is important, because identifying the replication of memes is subjective. Sometimes this identification is easy: <span class="rollover r-copy">one person acts, and another person copies</span> that person exactly. Other times the process of replication is less exact. This is why separating the manifestation, behaviour, and ideal is useful. As long as one of the three components is passed on, the meme is replicating, even if mutating and adapting.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Fitback (Fast Feedback Potential)</h3>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col col1of2">
            <div class="pd">
              <p>Summary: the <span class="rollover r-contemporary">contemporary</span> user is not only extremely sensitive to visual codes; connected to the web, he’s also in a position to establish communication over diverse <span class="rollover r-networks">networks</span>, penetrate microcosms and, potentially, reach the masses. He thereby demonstrates an exceptional (virtuosic?!), previously uncultivated skill with verbal and <span class="rollover r-sign">visual signs</span> – combining them and also creating them. Fast interaction becomes possible.</p>

              <p>I use the term Fitback to summarize this state of affairs and its possibilities. The fitness of the user, the give-and-go as practiced game move. Fitback is a spiritual power, a condition for Slippery Design. Without Fitback <span class="rollover r-culture">culture</span>, it’s hard to imagine Slippery Design, since the dynamics of production, the knowledge of codes and the associated reflective potential contain within themselves the spirit of the web.</p>

              <blockquote>“In the age of self-publishing and social media, the author function has splintered and multiplied. Society has changed, and so have the means of composing, consuming, and spreading the written word. ‘Author’ is now a role that anyone can play.” (Ellen Lupton, <span class="rollover r-read">Reading and Writing</span>, 2011)</blockquote>

              <p>Contained within the term Fitback is an understanding of the author-recipient relationship as formulated by <span class="rollover r-Eco">Umberto Eco</span>: “Every reception of a work of art is both an interpretation and a performance of it, because in every reception the work takes on a fresh perspective for itself.”(24)

          <div class="col col1of2">
          <div class="pd">
            <p>Just as the positions of sender and receiver are gradually blurred on the web in a gush of posts and reposts, forced to find themselves anew, the hybridization of the categories <span class="rollover r-reader">“reader”</span> and <span class="rollover r-author">“author”</span> grows ever more pronounced. Result: the birth of and, ultimately, demand for an active reading role.</p>

            <blockquote>“Users increasingly approach design with the expectation of having to fill in the blanks and actively insert content.” (Helen Armstrong, <span class="rollover r-pa">What is Participatory Design</span>, 2011)</blockquote>

            <p>This also, of course, affects design. Like the author, the superstar designer also dies, and an anarchic homemade design culture opens outward. Professional design clearly loses control of the visual field: the User(25) is born. His role evolves from single-track user of software to active participant (see Web 2.0).</p>

            <p>By way of antithesis to and rejection of the idea of the artistic <span class="rollover r-master">masterpiece</span>, <span class="rollover r-Brad">Brad Troemel</span> recently coined the term “aesthlete,” a visual artist, writer or musician distinguished primarily by his “rapid production” – and by the way he creates his own “self-mythology.” The goal is to generate the greatest possible amount of attention across <span class="rollover r-online">online platforms</span>, to achieve constant output on the web and inspire the ongoing rehashing of works, which only thereby become real. Time plays the decisive role here much more than previously privileged artistic qualities: “The tacit agreement between the <span class="rollover r-aesthlete">aesthlete</span> and the viewer is to be mutually indifferent toward quality understood as slick production value or refined craft. For aesthletes, the point of their work is not only what it expresses but the speed at which it’s expressed.”</p>

      <h1>Slippery Design</h1>
      <h2>Manuel Buerger</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Internet Aware Design</h3>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col col1of2">
          <div class="pd">
              <p>Slipping on the design object, bickering over understanding, searching for a foothold and meaning – all these effects of Slippery Design can be traced back to a democratisation of design culture. A knowledge of and sensitization to design and its role in our lives is now attended by know-how in <span class="rollover r-visual">visual grammar</span> and individual practical <span class="rollover r-experience">design experiences</span>.</p>

              <p>This phenomenon is a thankful invitation to accelerate the stretching of the term design, test common knowledge on the subject and search for a discussion outside of the elite, aesthetically oriented discourse. This essay seeks to do all three things</p>

              <p>I’m interested in a new intelligence that consists of distinguishing the most diverse <span class="rollover r-codes">visual codes</span> within the web’s legendary information flood, breaking them down and making connections between them. Ideas can thus be impressively transformed into forms, which, in turn, stimulate, train and nurture the mind. Today’s informational complexity is primarily a good thing. In it lies the essence of a complex and always reacting design.</p>

              <blockquote>“On October 13, 2012, there were around 77 million Tumblr and 56.6 million <span class="rollover r-blog">WordPress blogs</span> in existence worldwide.” (wikipedia.org/wiki/blog)</blockquote>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="col col1of2">
          <div class="pd">
            <p>Design thereby not only gains in complexity, but becomes part of the wrangling for attention and its attendant power, which the users ostensibly hold in their hands. “User generated content,” one of the most shunned concepts in the <span class="rollover r-web">Web 2.0</span> glossary, refers to anything brought into existence through the participation of <span class="rollover r-user">web users</span>, to which these usually conscious design decisions apply. Whence this primal flair for design? Why the insatiable preoccupation with shaping things?</p>

            <p><span class="rollover r-back">Back then (2008)</span>: <span class="rollover r-boris">Boris Groys</span> argued that modernity and the death of God prompted a change in the design of the unadorned soul, which became the “clothing of the body, its social, political and aesthetic appearance,” with the result that “where religion once was, design has emerged.” The god-given design of the soul, contended Groys, was replaced by <span class="rollover r-self">self-design</span>, which became “a creed.” “By designing one’s self and one’s environment in a certain way, one declares one’s faith in certain <span class="rollover r-value">values</span>, <span class="rollover r-attitude">attitudes</span>, <span class="rollover r-program">programs</span> and <span class="rollover r-ideology">ideologies</span>.”</p>

            <p>Today (2012): young authors like Brad Troemel define the user as a Creative Director conducting his own “<span class="rollover r-brand">online brand making</span>.” No one is surprised if we maintain various profiles and/or identities. We may be far better suited to expanding in difference and acting under multiple masks than we suspected. Maintaining visual sets with identity-establishing signs has become a substantial part of self-determination – both online and off.</p>
