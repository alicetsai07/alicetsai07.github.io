      A lover's Complaint
    </body>

    <p>'O, that infected moisture of his eye,
    O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd,
    O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,
    O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd,
    O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
    Would yet again betray the fore-betray'd,
    And new pervert a reconciled maid!'</p>

  
  <p>'That not a heart which in his level came
Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,
Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;
When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,
He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.</p>


<p>''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,
Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,
Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,
All vows and consecrations giving place:
O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,
In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,
For thou art all, and all things else are thine.</p>
